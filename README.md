## Introduction

**Innerocket** is a file transfer app designed to deliver both **trusted privacy** and **high-speed transfers**.

The name is a combination of two words:

- **inner** — representing close relationships, security, and private spaces
- **rocket** — symbolizing speed, efficiency, and immediacy

Together, these elements form the concept of Innerocket: a tool for **fast and secure file sharing between trusted people**.  
Whether you're sending a quick file to a friend or collaborating with a team, Innerocket ensures the process is **fast, private, and simple**.
